# BookApp

  BookApp is a web application that gives the user the ability to check available books (Already added to database) see their content (Abstract,ISBN,title,
  publish year and language) mark as favorite and unmark it. The user can obviously login and logout from the application as well. If logged in with the admin info,
  the user will be able to see the users list, edit a user , delete a user , edit a book , delete a book and add a new book.I worked with the **java EE** platform ,

  **DAO pattern** implementing Dao interfaces and using **MySql** database system.
